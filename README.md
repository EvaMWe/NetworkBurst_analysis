This is a network burst detection with the special feature to return a much broader bunch of parameters, that could be analysed with PCA afterwards.
This would make up much more possibilitied to characterize neuronal networks, to define standards and controls and to challenge therapeutics on cultured networks.

Open questions:
Tests must be performed - check on errors, where is code missing, which functions have to be restored
We already did tests on detection performance in neuronal cultures from rat, that were going well. More tests have to be performed.
